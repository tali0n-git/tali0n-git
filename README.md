# Hi there! 👋 
I'm Thalyann (tally-ANN), a data science apprentice on a journey to unlocking the potential of AI.

### What I'm Currently Working On:
- Mastering the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation using **Pandas** at The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship.
- Exploring various datasets to practice data cleaning, exploration, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.

### What I'm Currently Learning:
- Building a strong foundation in statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- Expanding my Python proficiency for data-related tasks and exploring key libraries like **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **scikit-learn**.

### Projects in Progress:
- **SlideHunter** an AI-powered tool for students and educators using Canvas. It searches through Canvas pages and slides, finding the most relevant sources of information to the user.
