# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Thalyann (tally-ANN), a data science apprentice on a journey to unlocking the potential of AI.

ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Working On:
- Mastering the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation using **Pandas** at The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship.
- Exploring various datasets to practice data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques.

ðŸ“š What I'm Currently Learning:
- Building a strong foundation in statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- Expanding my Python proficiency for data-related tasks and exploring key libraries like **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

ðŸš€ Projects in Progress:
- **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Prize Project:** A project focused on analyzing a public data set and improving upon an AI model's ability to efficiently learn new skills. I'm planning to use a simple regression model to guide the fine-tuning of the AI's hyperparameters.
- **Prime Number Pattern Analysis:** I'm also interested in implementing PCA techniques to identify patterns in prime number generation (in binary).
